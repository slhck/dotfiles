# Dotfiles

This is a repository of my dotfiles and OS X / Linux-specific installers.

**CAVEAT:** None of this is fully automated. Take whatever you need.

# Installation

1. Run the `installers/general.sh` script for general tool installation
2. Run the `installers/bootstrap.sh` script for copying the relevant files
3. Switch to ZSH (through `chsh`)
4. Run the `installers/zsh.sh` script for zsh-specific stuff

# Syncing Software

* Sublime Text 3: Copy the `Packages/User` folder
* iTerm 2:
  * Export/Import settings
  * Colors: `OceanicNext`
