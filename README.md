This is a repository of my dotfiles and OS X / Linux-specific installers.
It's not tested yet.

**WARNING: This may break stuff.***

Run the installers with

    git clone https://github.com/slhck/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
    ~/dotfiles/install-linux.rb

    git clone https://github.com/slhck/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
    ~/dotfiles/install-osx.rb

Then copy the rc-files to your `$HOME`.
